# algorithmWithJava

Welcome to my github page!
This folder is specifically for learning basic algorithms using Java. I have developed three phases to learn algorithms in a fun and enjoyable way.

Phase 1: Learn the Basic Concepts of Algorithms

In Phase 1, I learn the basic concepts of algorithms from YouTube, websites like BaeJoon and Programmers, and books. I also try to understand the intuition behind the algorithms.

Phase 2: Get Used to the New Knowledge

In Phase 2, I get used to the new knowledge by taking some online exams that are not too easy. I spend some time thinking about what approach will be applicable, and then I start coding, debugging, and checking my program logic. If I get stuck, I go back to Phase 1 to review again until I have an idea.

Phase 3: Share Knowledge and Improve

In Phase 3, I share examples with my classmates in Notion before I get started. Once I'm done, I gather all of my classmates and review the codes. If someone else's logic or code lines are more efficient and clean, I rewrite my code, but not exactly the same way. I always remind myself that there is always room for improvement in all codes.
