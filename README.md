# algorithmWithJava

Thanks for visiting my github page.
This folder is particularly aiming for learning basic algorithm using Java.

Here are my 3 phases to learn algorithm with fun and enjoyable.

Phase 1 - Learn basic concept of algorithms.
- Learning different type of algorithms from youtube, website(such as BaeJoon and Programmers)books.

Phase 2 - Get used to new knowledge.
- Takeing some online exam resources but not easy one. Spend some time to think what approach will be applicable. 
- Start coding, debug, check my program logic.
- When I get stuck, go back to Phase 1 to review again till I have an idea. 

Phase 3. - Knowledge Sharing
- Sharing example with my class mates in the Notions before I get started. 
- Once it's done, gathering all of class mates and review codes. 
- if someone else logic or code lines are more efficent and clean, rewrite my code but not exact same way. 
- Always reminds that there must be room for improvement of all codes.
